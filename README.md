# Analysis-of-Covid-19-based-Positive-or-Negative-tweets
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle and comprises tweets from India. The data acquired on 
Twitter is based on the hashtag search phrases COVID-19 and coronavirus. This is an all-text 
dataset including tweets from the social media network Twitter, which includes a range of 
tweets depending on the feelings individuals had during the pandemic lockdown.

Method 
Gensim and Word2Vec are the major methods utilized in this code. Gensim is a Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) package that does topic modelling, which is the process of 
extracting underlying subjects from enormous volume of text. Though topic modelling and 
word embedding are available in other packages such as scikit, R, and others, gensim's scope 
and depth of facilities for building and evaluating topic models, as well as many more 
convenient text processing features, are unrivalled. 
There are several word embedding models available today, each with their own set of 
advantages and disadvantages. The one we've selected here is the word2vec model. 
Word2Vec, suggested and backed by Google, is a combination of two learning models, 
Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram.
